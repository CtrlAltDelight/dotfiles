All my config files are listed here.

I also used the arc theme gtk and applied it using lxappearance.

Compton used for transparency.

For installing polybar, I used the speedricer PPA.

.vimrc uses seoul256 for the colorscheme. https://github.com/junegunn/seoul256.vim
Updated to automatically install seoul256 with vim-plug.
