# CtrlAltDelight's dotfiles

These files may not work for you immediately. Some configurations are specific to myself.

Right now I'm running arch linux with dwm. 

Neovim is now my primary editor (using init.lua as the rc), but I also have my .vimrc from when I used Vim.

I have this dotfiles directory in my home directory and I place symbolic links (look up ln -s) in my .config/ and home directories.

Feel free to use these files!
