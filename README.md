# dotfiles

These files may not work for you immediately. Some configurations are specific to myself.

Right now I'm running arch linux with dwm as my window manager (check out my dwm repository for that). 

Neovim is now my primary editor (using init.lua as the rc), but I also have my .vimrc from when I had used Vim. Everything should install itself in the .vimrc and init.lua.

I use kitty as my terminal emulator and X as my display manager. For compositing, I use picom. Rofi is still my application launcher of choice.

I have stopped using i3 and polybar, but keep the files for them here.

I have this dotfiles directory in my home directory and I place symbolic links (with the **ln -s** command) in my .config/ and home directories.

Feel free to use these files!
